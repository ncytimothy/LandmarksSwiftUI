var body: some View {
    Text("Hello Tim!")
        .font(.title) // these are called modifiers
            .color(.green) // each modifier creates a new view.
                    // There is an inherited option in the inspector of the canvas that will
                    // default the color to black. As if removing the .color(.green) modifier
